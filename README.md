# Software Design Patterns Study Guide
This project is designed to be a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing design patterns in C++. It was made in retrospect of the faculty course "Software Projecting", and the main goal is to make the study of design patterns easier for others. 

Each design pattern is placed in its own directory (DIR), in which you will find:

- Basic Example: A simple implementation of the design pattern to get you started.
- Practical Examples: Examples to showcase how the design pattern can be applied in various contexts.
- Description: A detailed explanation of the design pattern, including its intent, applicability, and structure.
- UML Diagram: A visual representation of the design pattern to aid in understanding its structure and the relationships between its components.

# How to Use
To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the directory of the design pattern you are interested in, and open the files in your preferred C++ development environment.
